                It is clear by looking at the table that many schools have experienced a drop in attendance over the last
                5 to 15 years. Listening to the reports in the media, many of the complaints coming from the teachers
                unions is that class sizes are increasing. Due to the number of teacher positions that have been cut
                over the last few years, I have to wonder what programs and classes are being cut in order to push the
                class sizes up?
            </p>
            <p>
                This data set only tells one side of the story, I would ask that the province considers releasing a new data
                set which shows a breakdown of all of the classes offered in each school per year. This makes a little more
                sense at the high school level than it does at an elementary level. But even at the youngest levels we
                could see how many children are in each elementary class. The data set would serve a few purposes.
                <ol>
                    <li>We could confirm that class sizes are indeed going up</li>
                    <li>We could analyze and see which programs and classes are being cut. Are any of those critical?</li>
                    <li>If for example a school once had </li>
                    <li>Are enough of our kids taking the vital courses needed to succeed in today's economy?</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Another area the new data set could benefit from is releasing gender statistics. Many work fields are
                dominated by one sex or the other. In the tech industry there is a big movement to ensure there is gender
                equality. Promoting technology to young women and encouraging them to enter the field is an important step.
                I think if the Education Department of PEI were to release the new data set containing the class information
                as proposed above, including the gender breakdown in each class would be a great step in understanding the
                trends of who/when are taking tech classes. Promotion and encouragement at a young age is important.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a great first step for the Open Data movement on PEI. I was so happy to see many departments buy
                into the system and release 1-2 data sets to start. Not trying to do too much too early. I hope that
                over time each department in government realizes the importance of open data and continues to open
                more data and listen to their data consumers on ways to improve and grow.
